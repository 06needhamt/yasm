This directory demonstrates how to build a basic plugin.
It does not need access to the yasm source, only an installed yasm.

To build:
  mkdir objdir
  cd objdir
  cmake ..
  make

Testing:
  yasm -N ./libdbgmod.so -f dbg -
     db 5
     ^D
(result lines will have PLUGIN prefixed to the function calls; this
demonstrates the plugin is being used rather than the builtin dbg module)
