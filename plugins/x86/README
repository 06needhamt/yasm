This directory demonstrates how to build a yasm builtin module as a plugin.
This can be useful for integrating custom changes without
rebuilding/reinstalling yasm.
It requires access to the yasm source.

The yasm source directory must be defined to cmake, e.g.
  mkdir objdir
  cd objdir
  cmake -DYASM_SOURCE_DIR=/home/foo/yasm ..
  make
