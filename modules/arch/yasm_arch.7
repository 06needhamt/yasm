.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The standard YASM distribution includes a number of loadable modules for different target architectures\&. Additional target architectures may be installed as third\-party modules\&. Each target architecture can support one or more machine architectures\&.

.PP
The architecture and machine are selected on the \fByasm\fR(1) command line by use of the \fB\-a \fIarch\fR\fR and \fB\-m \fImachine\fR\fR command line options, respectively\&.

.SH "X86 ARCHITECTURE"

.PP
The ``x86'' architecture supports the IA\-32 instruction set and derivatives and the AMD64 instruction set\&. It consists of two machines: ``x86'' (for the IA\-32 and derivatives) and``amd64'' (for the AMD64 and derivatives)\&. The default machine for the ``x86'' architecture is the``x86'' machine\&.

.SH "LC3B ARCHITECTURE"

.PP
The ``lc3b'' architecture supports the LC\-3b ISA as used in the ECE 312 (now ECE 411) course at the University of Illinois, Urbana\-Champaign, as well as other university courses\&. See \fIhttp://courses.ece.uiuc.edu/ece411/\fR for more details and example code\&. The ``lc3b'' architecture consists of only one machine: ``lc3b''\&.

.SH "BUGS"

.PP
When using the ``x86'' architecture, it is overly easy to generate AMD64 code (using the \fBBITS 64\fR directive) and generate a 32\-bit object file (by failing to specify\fB\-m amd64\fR on the command line)\&. Similarly, specifying\fB\-m amd64\fR does not default the BITS setting to 64\&.
