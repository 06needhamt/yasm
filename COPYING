YASM licensing overview and summary
-----------------------------------

Note: This document does not provide legal advice nor is it the actual license
of any part of YASM.  See the individual licenses for complete details.
Consult a laywer for legal advice.

The primary license of YASM is the 2-clause BSD license.  Please use this
license if you plan on submitting code to the project.

Libyasm
-------
Libyasm is 2-clause or 3-clause BSD licensed, with the exception of bitvect,

is free for binary-only distribution as long as the terms of the 3-clause BSD
license and Artistic license (as it applies to bitvect) are fulfilled.
